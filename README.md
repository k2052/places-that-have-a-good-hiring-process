# Places That Have a Good Hiring Process

I have recently begun an epic search for a job. There are ample places to find job listings but there are no resources that list places with a good hiring process. What follows is a very rough and very *subjective* list of places that have a hiring process I find likable

## The Criteria

Any good hiring process (for me) must meet the following criteria;

1. Should be documented (this is the most important thing). If it isn't documented you have no idea what you are getting into before you go for the job.
2. Remote friendly. This doesn't mean remote only. It means I can get 90% of my work done via Slack and GitHub. It means no meetings. It means an asynchronous communication process that doesn't forcibly interfere with flow. It means a flexible schedule that doesn't have you coding yourself into an early grave.
3. It must be accepting and friendly. This is very subjective but there are red flags that one can look for.
4. It must evaluate candidates using a candidate friendly process, ideally a paid trial run that evaluates the candidate's ability to actually do the job. A friendly process doesn't mean no whiteboarding, it just means no whiteboarding for things like frontend dev. Whiteboarding should be for evaluating programmers that have to actually write algorithms.

And ideally;

1. Has a documented intent to hire well. If a company has made an attempt to document and blog about their hiring process, blog about what is like to work there etc; then that is indicative they care about hiring.

## Places With a Documented Hiring Process

[Clef](https://getclef.com/about/#opportunities)

Clef has an [open employee handbook](https://github.com/clef/handbook) and have been very public in their desire to craft a friendly and diverse workplace. If they live up even a tiny bit to their motto of "Be better today than yesterday" it has got to be a great place to work. They run what I have heard are awesome dinners in Oakland, so if you happen to be in the bay area that would be a good way to get over anxiety and get to meet them before applying. Their medium series called "Two Factor Authenticity" is a great place to gain insight into the company and what is like to work there https://medium.com/two-factor-authenticity

[Buffer](https://buffer.com/journey)

Buffer is the one that did the open hiring process thing long before it was cool. Even the salaries at Buffer are open. I don't know anyone at Buffer but a company that cares this much about hiring has got to be better than most.

## Places That are Very Remote Friendly

The following companies are very remote centric. They are great for candidates needing to work anywhere. They are also well suited to humans with issues that might make working in an office environment difficult.

[Automattic](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/)

Automattic is well known for their CEO taking an active interest in hiring. Your app goes to the CEO first and then onto divisions. Few places as large as Automattic have a CEO that is their first filter in the hiring process, that sounds like a great place to work! There is a great blog post about their hiring process at http://davemart.in/2015/04/22/inside-automattics-remote-hiring-process/. The only downside is that their pay during trial runs is very minimal (only $25/hr), however you can juggle the trial project and work it into your existing schedule.

## Places Known to Have a Trial Run Hiring Process

These companies give you a short paid project instead of requiring you to whiteboard or something similar.

[Webflow](https://webflow.com/about#jobs)

Their hiring process is not documented on their site but I went through the hiring process awhile back. It was a very typical trial run process you encounter at most remote friendly companies. It was stress free, compensated well, smooth, well prepared (they already have issues set aside for candidates), and the CEO was very friendly and reachable. You are paid at your desired hourly rate and given a GitHub issue that takes about a week to finish up. You tackle the issue, make a pull request, go through a code review, and finally you push it to production. If you have done open source work you have done their process before.

## Places That are Possibly Good

[Segment](https://segment.com/jobs/)

This company is very open source centric. I would theorize that with such an Open Source centric company their process must be very asynchronous and remote friendly. That said, there are few blog posts about their hiring process.

[SumAll](https://sumall.com/careers)

SumAll has a open salary policy like Buffer. Other than that I was not able to discover a lot about their hiring process.

## Resources

I haven't included by any means all the companies out there with good hiring processes. Sometimes it takes some looking to find one. Here are some good places to start:

1. https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs
2. https://weworkremotely.com/
3. HN Who's Hiring Threads. There is a site that compiles them http://hnhiring.me/
4. [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com). For most of the larger tech companies you can head over to Glassdoor and read experiences from those who went through the process.

## Contributions

Contributions to this list are welcome! This is a subjective list of places with a good hiring process; it reflects what I find pleasant and desirable in a hiring process. That said, it is my hope for it to be useful to others, so I'm happy to accept pull requests and issues!
